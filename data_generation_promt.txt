##### THIS WAS USED TO GENERATE THE EXAMPLES WITH CLAUDE 3.5 SONNET

I'd like you to create some fake IT service tickets that contain (fake PII). 

The types of PII are:
NAMES : Names of user, colleagues or customers
FILE_ID : a 6 to 8 digit number
WORK_EMAIL: Email addresses with domain @lloydsbanking.com, @halifax.com, @clericalmedical.com
PERSONAL_EMAIL : Email addresses with personal domains e.g. @gmail.com, @yahoo.com, @hotmail.com
PHONE_NUMBER : UK phone number
CREDIT_CARD : CREDIT CARD NUMBER
RESIDENTIAL_ADDRESS : UK residential address
CREDENTIALS : Application passwords and usernames

Please generates 25 samples. Include FILE_ID and WORK_EMAIL in every example and then include 2 to 3 of the other PII elements in each ticket.

Please wrap all examples up into a single json formatted list as in the below example:

[
    {
        "text" : [
            "Hello I'm having trouble logging into my Service Now account.",
            "My name is Angelica Hubbard and my file id is 9294558.",
            "My work email is angie.hubbard@lloydsbanking.com.",
            "My personal email is anghub@gmail.com.",
            "Please forward any personal emails to my home address: 12 Ditton Road, Surrey, TH9 7HK."
        ],
        "entities" : [
            {
                "type" : "NAME", 
                "text" : "Angelica Hubbard"
            },

            {
                "type" : "FILE_ID", 
                "text" : "9294558"
            },

            {
                "type" : "WORK_EMAIL", 
                "text" : "angie.hubbard@lloydsbanking.com"
            },

            {
                "type" : "PERSONAL_EMAIL", 
                "text" : "anghub@gmail.com"
            },

            {
                "type" : "RESIDENTIAL_ADDRESS", 
                "text" : "12 Ditton Road, Surrey, TH9 7HK"
            }
        ]
    }
